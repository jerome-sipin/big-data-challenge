This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the big data homework.

This was pretty simple until trying to update the AWS RDS segment. I couldn't figure out how to
connect the Colab notebook to my local Postgres DB (although I was able to connect
the Postgres DB to RDS). I tried pasting code I found on Stack Overflow, but it returned that the
username (I tried a bunch of them, such as 'admin' or 'postgres', but it didn't take those). After
a bit of contemplating, I decided to prioritize the project over this homework, so I gave up at that point.
